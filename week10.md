I'm Back!!! YAY!!

Yay! It's the final week of the program! I thank God for this opportunity, and reaching this stage with my team is all by His grace. It's week 10—wow, how did it go so fast? Here's a brief rundown of my week:

The week began with my team and I heading to our labs. We started by finalizing our technical paper and doing a demo practice for our final presentation. We also took some time to take pictures and enjoy our last few days together. Day 2 was the day of the final presentation. We presented well, and I was kind of relieved that no one asked us questions—I assumed everyone understood our aim. On the final day, we wrapped everything up and collected our certificates.

A huge thank you to Ms. Blessing Adeika, our graduate mentor, for your constant support. I wouldn't have been able to complete this program without you. Thanks to my teammates for their sisterly love—you all made my summer a fun one. Thanks to CEAMLS for allowing me to venture into the AI/ML world. I do appreciate it. Best summer ever!

Thank you for reading, and enjoy the rest of your summer!
