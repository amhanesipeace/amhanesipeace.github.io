I'm Back!!! YAY!!!

Week three started with my team learning, being productive, and collaborating, packed with various activities and accomplishments that have significantly contributed to our project's progress.
We started the week with a fantastic session on academic writing led by Dr. Anita Pandey. Her insights on clear and concise writing were invaluable. She highlighted how using visuals effectively and citing credible sources can enhance the quality of our research. Her strategies for maintaining an analytical approach in our writing were beneficial, setting a solid foundation for our future work.
Next, we revisited the introductory Python classes from last week and worked on some literature review tasks. Each of us reviewed four pieces of literature to deepen our understanding of relevant topics. This exercise strengthened our grasp of the subjects and honed our critical analysis skills.
Our training on NumPy was extensive. We started with the basics and moved on to more advanced topics, covering everything from creating arrays to array indexing, slicing, reshaping, and filtering. This hands-on practice was essential in solidifying our understanding of these powerful tools, which are essential for our data analysis and Machine Learning tasks.
We also began working on tasks related to OpenCV, focusing on image acquisition, preprocessing, and loading where Ms Blessing guided us on how we can read an Image, convert color to grey, and convert greyscale image to black and white. These skills are pivotal for the image analysis components of our project, and the practical experience we gained this week was invaluable.
Another highlight was an introductory session on writing documents with Overleaf. We learned how to use this tool to prepare high-quality research documents, and I managed to create my first document on Overleaf. This new skill will undoubtedly be useful as we progress in our research.
Providing constructive feedback on our peers' weekly group videos was challenging but rewarding. It required us to strike a balance between offering helpful critiques and maintaining a positive tone. This exercise was a great learning experience in communication and teamwork.
We also had a research talk with Dr. Gloria Washington on Voice AI and African American Vernacular. Announced at short notice, this talk was particularly insightful. Her discussion provided a unique perspective on the intersection of AI and cultural linguistics, broadening our understanding of how technology can interact with and impact diverse cultural contexts.
The week ended with a visit to the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL). This visit was truly enlightening. We explored the implementation of AI/ML in diverse fields such as neuroscience, robotics, and climate science. The cutting-edge technologies and research methodologies showcased during the visit were impressive, broadening our perspective on the potential impacts of AI/ML across various domains.
In summary, this week has been incredibly productive. The diverse range of activities, from Dr. Pandey's writing session to the advanced Python and NumPy training, and the visit to JHU/APL, has significantly enhanced our skills and knowledge. I look forward to applying these new insights in the upcoming weeks as we go deeper into our research.
