I'm Back!!! YAY!!

This week was a rollercoaster of learning and experiences, starting right from Monday. We kicked off with an intriguing session on AI and its impact on education, led by Dr. Riggs at the business building. She showed us captivating YouTube videos about how AI is being used in schools in China, and we even got a glimpse of Suno, an AI tool that can create songs based on a few lyrics, themes, and genres we provided. It was quite fascinating. Later, we had a writing session with Dr. Anita Pandey and met a new participant in our group, Ronald Saul, a high school teacher. His primary field is science and he has 14 years of teaching experience. Unfortunately, I couldn’t interact much with him as I was having a tough day, but my teammates had positive things to say about him. We wrapped up the day with a NumPy tutorial in our respective labs.

Tuesday was all about going deeper into NumPy. We focused on NumPy Random like Random Intro, Data Distribution, Random Permutation, Seaborn Module, Normal Distribution, Binomial Distribution, Poison Distribution, Uniform Distribution, Logistic Distribution, Multinomial Distribution, Exponential Distribution, Chi-Square Distribution And NumPy ufunc like ufunc Intro, ufunc Create Function, ufunc Simple Arithmetic, ufunc Rounding Decimals, ufunc Logs, ufunc Summations, ufunc Products, ufunc Differences, ufunc Finding LCM, ufunc Finding GCD, ufunc Trigonometric, ufunc Hyperbolic, and ufunc Set Operations. Dr. Saroj Pramanik also gave us a brief lecture on plant biology. I found it a bit hard to follow, but I managed to jot down some key points. The hands-on practice with NumPy was especially useful and really helped cement my understanding.

Wednesday was Juneteenth, so we had the day off. I used this opportunity to start my Pandas tutorial and took some much-needed time to relax and recharge.

On Thursday, the international students, including myself, headed to the lab while the citizens went to NASA. It felt a bit unfair, but I made the most of the day by continuing with my Pandas tutorial. I also managed to submit my Week 3 journal, as the submission link was posted late and provided feedback on team videos from the previous week.

Friday was equally productive. We began the day by writing our journals for Week 4 and preparing presentations for our team's videos. Then, we had a 20-minute literature review session with Dr. Pandey, which was incredibly insightful. The day wrapped up with tackling some OpenCV tasks, focusing on performing operations on our dataset, including loading, data cleaning, and classification.

Overall, this week was filled with valuable learning experiences and productive activities. Despite the challenges, I’m excited about the progress we’ve made and look forward to applying these new skills and insights as we continue with our research.


Have a productive week
