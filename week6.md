I'm Back!!! YAY!!

This week has been quite an eventful one. We started Monday off by going straight to our labs, guided by an email from our graduate mentor that laid out our tasks for the day. The morning section focused on CNN models—reading more about them, watching a tutorial video, and then fine-tuning our CNN model. We evaluated its performance using the validation dataset, made necessary adjustments, and even implemented additional layers or changes to enhance the model's architecture. The afternoon was dedicated to evaluating the model's performance again, completing leftover tasks from last week, merging our Introduction and Literature Review into one document, and designing slides for our Mid-Summer Presentation. With the symposium presentation coming up on Wednesday, we spent a lot of time revising everything we had been working on so far.

Tuesday was a special day—it was my birthday! I came in full of energy, ready to make the most of it. Our tasks for the day revolved around finalizing our presentation. We had a practice session with Dr. Anita Pandey, who provided us with invaluable feedback. Just as we were wrapping up, Dr. Naja Mack informed us that the presentation had been postponed, and a mid-summer town hall would be held instead.

Wednesday began with another email from our mentor, which included links to some Data Science and Machine Learning videos we were to watch and practice with. We attended the town hall meeting later, where students voiced their thoughts, complaints, and suggestions for the program. It was an enlightening experience. I realized that other teams were facing different challenges, unlike my team, which I had assumed everyone was in the same happy phase as us.

Thursday was Independence Day—no work! We took a break and celebrated the holiday.

Friday, we were back to the grind. We started by writing our journals for Week 6 and noted that no presentation video was required this week. Our mentor gave us a deeper understanding of Plant Leaf detection using CNN, ensuring that my teammates and I were on the same page. We also had a 20-minute literature review session with Dr. Pandey, which was incredibly insightful.

Overall, this week was a blend of intense work and valuable learning, punctuated by some fun and celebration. Despite the ups and downs, I'm excited about the progress we've made and can't wait to apply these new skills and insights as we continue our research.

Have a productive weekend!!!
