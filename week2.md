This week was the start for our project work and training sessions. It started with us attending the Researching to Write and Writing to Research, session where we learned the importance of clear, concise, and impactful writing in research. The sessions covered valuable strategies for organizing research content, using visuals, citing credible sources, and maintaining an analytical approach in our writing. I also completed the CITI Program training, earning certificates in Social and Behavioral Responsible Conduct of Research and Social & Behavioral Research - Basic/Refresher. This training was essential for understanding the research ethics and methodologies we’ll be using in our project.

One of the best part was reconnecting with my amazing team members, our faculty mentor Professor Saroj Pramanik, and our incredible graduate mentor Ms. Blessing Adeika. Dr. Saroj started things off by introducing us to plant cells, diseases, and the critical aspects needed for our project. We reviewed the differences between plant and animal cells, focusing on structural features like the presence of cell walls, chloroplasts, and large central vacuoles in plant cells, and their absence in animal cells. We also learned that plants are not immune and have various defense mechanisms such as mechanical defenses (thorns, trichomes), and chemical defenses (alkaloids, toxic chemicals), which are vital for protecting plants from hostile environments despite their ability to develop diseases.

Ms. Blessing guided us through the basics of Python, helping us understand key functions and their applications in our project. With her support, I managed to complete the Python tutorial in just five days. At first, I struggled with understanding some Python functions, but with continuous support and encouragement from Ms. Blessing, I overcame these challenges.
In general, this week has been a foundational and enlightening experience, setting the stage for our project. I’m excited about the progress we’ve made and look forward to being more productive in the coming weeks.
