Yay! Another week wrapped up, and I thank God for this opportunity. It's week 8, and I'm getting used to how quickly the weeks are flying by as we get closer to the end of the program. Here's a brief rundown of my accomplishments and challenges for this week:

I started the week by going into drafting the abstract, introduction, and methodology for our technical paper. It was a productive start, and by the end of the day, we had also started working on our pitch video and managed to complete it.

Throughout the rest of the week, we focused on editing the video and training the CNN model using a broader dataset of 125,361 images. This task was particularly draining due to the total volume of images. Initially, I tried downloading the dataset, which took the entire day and still resulted in some images not showing up. After hours of waiting and frustration, our mentor, Miss Blessing, suggested using the API format. This turned out to be much easier and faster, but I still faced challenges because the images were scattered across different folders and subfolders. With my mentor's help, I eventually figured out a simpler way to handle it and proceeded with training the model. I'm still working on this task, but the progress is steady.

Additionally, I worked on drafting the slides for our final presentation. This draft will help us prepare the final template for our big presentation. We also went deeper into the YOLOv9 model and continued editing our websites.

Overall, it was a productive and busy week, but we are making steady progress, which is the most important thing. Thank you for reading, and have a great one!
