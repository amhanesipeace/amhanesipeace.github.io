I'm Back!!! YAY!!

This week was a whirlwind of activities and learning experiences, kicking off right from Monday. We received an email update informing us that, due to logistical conflicts, we wouldn’t be meeting in the business building. Instead, we headed to our respective labs and picked up where we left off last Friday. My tasks included researching the best models for fruit leaf disease detection, acquiring image datasets of diseased leaves, and loading these images into a pandas DataFrame. We were also assigned a new task to load data into Google Colab, perform basic data processing, and research CNN models for training operations. I initially misunderstood this task and only downloaded the test dataset.

Tuesday was a bit of a setback as I couldn't come to work due to illness. However, I made sure to inform my mentors about my absence.

Wednesday started with me revisiting the Monday assignment I had misunderstood. I downloaded the full datasets and worked on processing the images and setting up a basic CNN model for training. I wrote and executed code for these tasks, ensuring I followed the corrected instructions this time.

Thursday was exciting as we prepared for a visit from high school students, giving them an overview of our project. Later, we focused on drafting our technical paper. Each team member had reviewed at least 10 papers. My tasks included drafting the introduction section and summarizing the literature reviews.

Friday was equally productive. We responded to our peers' Week 4 videos, wrote our Week 5 journals, and prepared our team presentations. Additionally, we had more review sessions on plant diseases with Dr. Saroj Pramanik and a 20-minute literature review session with Dr. Pandey.

Overall, this week was a blend of valuable learning experiences and productive activities. Despite the challenges, I’m excited about the progress we’ve made and look forward to applying these new skills and insights as we continue with our research.

Have a productive weekend!!!
