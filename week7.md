I'm Back!!! YAY!!

This week has been just like every other week, starting with our usual Monday routine in the labs. Dr. Naja Mack sent an email instructing us to head to our labs and mentioned she'd update us on the makeup presentations. Our graduate mentor had us creating a comprehensive flowchart for the project, covering everything from data acquisition to literature reviews, models used, and results. We also focused on training and fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the CNN model while diving into research on YOLOv9 models.

Tuesday brought a sense of urgency with an email from Dr. Naja announcing that the midsummer presentations were scheduled for the next day at 9 AM in the Behavioral & Science Center (BSSC). We worked through our tasks for the day, working on tasks like implementing YOLOv9 models, designing a flowchart for the literature review, starting the web design for our project, and preparing for our midsummer presentation demo. We also had a practice presentation session with our mentor, who provided valuable feedback.

Wednesday was the big day for our midsummer presentation. My team was the fifth group to present. The nerves were real, especially since it was our first research presentation. But by the end of the day, we felt a great sense of accomplishment and had a clear idea of what we needed to improve.

Thursday was all about doing something newâ€”website development. Our high school teacher participant was incredibly supportive and guided us through the process. We also continued our research and implementation of YOLOv9 models, which added a new layer of understanding to our project.

Friday wrapped up the week with journal writing for Week 7 and working on our presentation video. Our mentor dedicated time to explain more about plant leaf detection using the YOLOv9 model, ensuring we had a solid understanding of the concepts. We also had a 20-minute Zoom literature review session with Dr. Pandey, which was insightful.

Overall, this week was a blend of intense work, learning new skills, and receiving valuable feedback. Despite the challenges, I'm excited with the progress we've made and look forward to applying these new insights as we continue with our research.

Have a productive weekend!!!
