I'm Back!!! YAY!!

Yay! It's the penultimate week till we wrap up the program, and I thank God for this opportunity. Reaching this stage with my team is all by His grace. It's week 9, and I'm amazed at how quickly the weeks are flying by. Here's a brief rundown of my week:

The week began with an engaging NSA session that offered valuable insights about cybersecurity from various speakers. Throughout the week, I took charge of training the CNN model, working on the predictions, and doing the final hyperparameter tunings. I also spent time editing my part of the technical paper, creating a Canva slide, and contributing to the presentation slides.

The most challenging part was training separate models for each category. It was a real struggle as it took me 24 hours to train the 10 different fruits. Despite the difficulties, these efforts are part of our preparations for the final week of presentations and deliveries.

Thank you for reading, and Have a productive weekend!!!
