During the first week, I met with Dr. Kofi Nyarko and Dr. Naja Mack to enlighten and make us understand what was expected of us this Summer AI Research Institute, and also my faculty mentors and my graduate mentor to discuss the project 
that my team and I will be working on.
Also, I learned about computer science, computation thinking, algorithms,type casting, the basic stages of Python, Git, and Github, Numpy,and different platforms I could use python
I believe within the next few weeks, i would havee improved.
