Peace Osiriamen Amhanesi

During the first week, I met with Dr. Kofi Nyarko and Dr. Naja Mack to enlighten and make us understand what was expected of us this Summer AI Research Institute, and also my faculty mentors and my graduate mentor to discuss the project 
that my team and I will be working on.
Also, I learned about computer science, computation thinking, and its four main elements (Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Algorithm Design), algorithms and The Properties (Input/Output, Finite, Definite, Effective, General), type casting, responsible and ethical conduct of research, data structures, the basic stages of Python, Git, Github, Numpy, and different platforms I could use Python
My graduate mentor Asked us to research AI/ML on plant life disease detection, and I got four papers submitted to a spreadsheet she provided.
I did encounter issues with the sorting of NumPy, I did not understand because she was quite in a hurry
Within the next few weeks, I will have improved.
